# 🏆 GitHub Projects
Currently Working on: 
### 🏦 Post Earnings Announcement Drift Predictor
A FinTech project focused on the Drift anomaly that occurs post-earnings announcements for numerous time intervals while accounting for the Value-Glamour anomaly as well.
- Dataset extraction from yfinance and AlphaVantage
- Q&A Earnings transcripts sentiment analysis using FinBert Model
- Feature engineering involves creating technical indicators, statistical metrics, and incorporating alternative data.
- **Planning** on incorporating a multi-modal neural network as the model. 

### Reinforcement Learning powered MLB Bullpen Strategy
- Constructing an environment that includes all game-time factors, such as In-game status, Batter handedness and current form, bullpen current form, and Upcoming lineup statistics.
- **Planning** on constructing a model-free agent to develop a strategy on whether to keep or pull a pitcher from the game and who to replace them with.

Completed:
### 👃 ScentFinder
A complete pipeline from scraping to model building and evaluation to output niche fragrance recommendations based on favourite notes and accords:
- Web scraping of notes plus a pre-cleaned dataset from Kaggle
- Compares two pipelines of SVD + kNN and Masked Autoencoder + kNN
- Integrates a hybrid model of OpenAI-generated personas (preferences) + Sparse fragrance encodings for Affinity.
- Uses Maximum Marginal Relevance to reorder recommender rankings to output more diverse recommendations. 


### 🛡️ Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection  
An end-to-end pipeline tackling highly imbalanced fraud detection using ML models:  
- Implements **XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks**  
- Evaluates models using **PR-AUC**, a strong metric for skewed datasets  
- Integrates **stratified cross-validation, feature scaling, undersampling, and class weighting**  
- Achieved a **23% recall improvement** compared to logistic regression baselines  

*(More projects will be added as they become public!)*
